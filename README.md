# ledger-desktop

a desktop app for [ledger](https://ledger-cli.org). it uses local ledger binary to maintain full compatibility with plain cli use.

first goal is to implement a desktop app for myself to simplify data entry for myself + provide some visualizations.

long term goal is to define conventions for ledger data and build more features around it like budgeting, stocks tracking, etc.
